# Learning Functional Programming with Haskell

## The Goals:
1. Understand the core concepts of Functional Programming.
2. Have a toolkit of knowledge that I can use for work or anywhere it could apply.
3. Having fun!

## Where I am now
As someone coming from the Object Oriented land, I am all too familiar with the FP vs OOP debate, though I would say I can't really place one over the other convincingly as I never got into FP in the first place. 
I am familiar with some concepts such as **purity** and **composition** because I do *try* to apply it in OOP, especially composition (see [composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)).

Now I see myself in FP land.

Admittedly, it felt like a mess of code at first. 
There were little sights of classes.
Composing, currying, arities, and such.

If I want to keep up, I have to learn all of these.

## The plan
1. Learn the basic syntax and concepts of Haskell enough to be able to write proof of concepts.
2. Apply what I learn to create a simple API at the very minimum.

## Progress
[x] Learn basic syntax for functions, lists, types, and typeclasses.
[x] Create basic CLI app.
[ ] Learn about monads
[ ] Using Haskell tools (haskell-stack?)
[ ] Create an API
